# XamarinAssessment

This is just a sample project set up to demonstrate and understanding of Xamarin crossplatform development and MVVM architecture.



Some things to note:
 - Dependnecy injection is demonstrated in App.cs of the shared project. Change UseMockDataStore to false to write to SQLite db on the phone instead of the mock database.
 - NUnit project is there just as a demonstation of understanding the setup of unit tests/unit test project, there could be many more unit tests.
